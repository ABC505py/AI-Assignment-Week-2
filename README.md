# 🏥 Predicting Disease Outbreaks using Machine Learning

## 🌍 SDG Problem Addressed: 
This project supports **United Nations SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**, by aiming to **predict disease outbreaks** before they occur. This allows for early intervention, resource allocation, and improved public health response.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach:
We used a **Logistic Regression Classifier** on a Kaggle health dataset with features such as temperature, humidity, population density, access to healthcare, and historical outbreak data. The dataset was cleaned and normalized, followed by model training and evaluation.

## 📊 Results:
- **Accuracy:** 85% (example)
- The model successfully identified high-risk periods with good precision and recall.
- Future improvement: Incorporate real-time data and deep learning models (LSTM or GRU).

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations:
- Ensure data privacy and protection.
- Avoid bias against regions with low reporting accuracy.
- Use predictions to support—not replace—human decisions.
